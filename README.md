# Docker-image-optimization

## Image Optimization:
- When we run a Container from an image, It gets loaded into RAM. This means that if image size is large the entire large of data is loaded into RAM.
- If image is large, it gets more time to load inti RAM, which in turn increases the time required to launch Container.
- The image size directly impacks performance.
- A large image size image size results in higher CPU & RAM usage, leading to increase costs.
